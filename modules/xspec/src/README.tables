xspec12 dropped the fortran interface for table models in favor
of a C++ interface.  Since the C++ interface is difficult to
use from a C main program, I opted to copy the xspec11 fortran
code and use that to support table models.  This should work
for tables that support the old format but if new formats are
introduced it will obviously fail.  I'll cross that bridge when
I come to it.
