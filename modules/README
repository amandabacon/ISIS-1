This directory contains modules which provide optional
functionality for ISIS.  They are normally compiled as
dynamically linked modules which may optionally be loaded at
run-time.  For systems lacking ELF support, these modules may
additionally support being statically linked to ISIS.

See the individual module directories for installation
instructions.
