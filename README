The code here provides a slang module for the CFITSIO library.  It
also provides a higher-level interface to the module via the slang
wrappers in src/fits.sl.

See the documentation in the doc/ directory for information
about using the module, or, for the most up to date version, see
<http://space.mit.edu/CXC/software/slang/modules/cfitsio/>.

To build the code, you will need the following additional libraries:

   1.  The slang library (http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/)
   2.  The CFITSIO library
       (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html)

You must run the configure script before you can compile the module.
If either the slang or cfitsio libraries are installed in
non-standard locations, then you will need to specify the locations of
these libraries as arguments to the configure script.  For example,
suppose libslang.so is located in /home/bill/lib and its include file
slang.h is located in /home/bill/include.  Similarly, assume the cfitsio
library and include files are located in /home/bill/opt/lib and
/home/bill/opt/include, respectively.  Then one would run the 
configure script using:

  ./configure --with-slanglib=/home/bill/lib \
              --with-slanginc=/home/bill/include \
              --with-cfitsiolib=/home/bill/opt/lib \
              --with-cfitsioinc=/home/bill/opt/include

or, the shorter form which assumes a common pathname prefix for the
lib include directories:


  ./configure --with-slang=/home/bill --with-cfitsio=/home/bill/opt

You should also specify a location for the modules (*.so) and any associated
script (*.sl) files created by this package.  The default location for
the modules is in

   $prefix/lib/slang/modules/

Any .sl files will be installed in

   $exec_prefix/share/slsh/local-packages/

where the values of the variable $prefix defaults to /usr/local, and
that of $exec_prefix to the value of $prefix.  These values may be
changed using the --prefix and --exec-prefix configure script
parameters.  For example, to set the value of $prefix to /home/bill,
use

   ./configure --prefix=/home/bill ...

For more help using the configure script, run it using 

   ./configure --help

It is also a good idea to read the INSTALL.txt file located in this
directory.

Once the configure script has been run, it is a good idea to inspect
the Makefile that it generated in the src directory.  Then building
and installing the library should involve nothing more than:

   make 
   make install

You may have to have root privileges to peform the last step.
