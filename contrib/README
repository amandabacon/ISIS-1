These scripts were contributed by various users and have
appeared as examples on the ISIS web page at
   http://space.mit.edu/cxc/isis/

Note: These scripts are included here in the hope that they may
      provide useful examples. However, they are not maintained
      and may even be incompatible with the current version of
      ISIS.

aped_contin.sl
        Define an apec model which computes the apec continuum
	spectrum for 1 temperature component.  Does not support
	continuua by ion or for variable abundances
        [** also the ISIS function 'create_aped_fun']

aped_fit_models.sl
        Define isis user models for aped thermal plasmas.
        [** also the ISIS function 'create_aped_fun']	

ascii.sl
        Read and write simple ASCII tables [note that the
	isis built-in functions readcol/writecol already
	do this]

bestfit.sl
        Generate N random initial parameter values to search
	for the best fit.  Very useful for exploring a complicated
	chi-square space with numerous local minima.

clear_bits*
        Clear STATUS bits in an Chandra event file

cspec_summary.sl
        Generate summary plots for a grating spectrum [counts]

fshift.sl
        Shift an array by a fractional pixel amount (FFT phase
	shift)

fspec_summary.sl
        Generate summary plots for a flux-corrected grating
	spectrum.

gsmooth.sl
        Fourier smoothing by a Gaussian kernel.

hanning.sl
        Hanning filter

marxflux*
        Generate an input spectrum for a MARX simulation

max_like.sl
        Maximum Likelihood fit-statistic

monte.sl
        Monte Carlo search of a model fit-parameter space.

pick_el.sl
        Takes a line index list (as from "brightest()") and
	allows you to sub-select elements and ions from it.

splot_data.sl
        Smoothed data plotting (counts or flux-corrected)
