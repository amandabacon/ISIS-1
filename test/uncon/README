If you're too busy to read the instructions, just type 'make'.
If you have problems, try reading this file.

These Fortran routines probably require your Fortran compiler
to use static memory allocation for subroutine calls.
For g77, use the "-fno-automatic" option.

If you compile without the analogous option, the tests will
probably crash or produce garbage results. If this happens:

  1. edit the Makefile to provide the -fno-automatic option,
     (or the analogous option for your compiler)
  2. make veryclean
  3. make

The plots compare a "figure of demerit"
     D = N*exp(error)
for each minimizer. In this expression, 'error' is a measure of
the error in the answer and 'N' is a measure of the cost (e.g.
number of function evaluations).  Perfection would be N=1,
error=0, giving D=1.  Therefore D>1 is a measure of how bad the
optimizer is. Read the code for details.

Using this figure of demerit to compare to optimizers, x and y,
one can examine the ratio R = D(x)/D(y).
When x is better, R < 1.  When y is better, R > 1.

Of course, there's some degeneracy because even if R=1, one
solver maybe have taken a bit longer to find a better answer.
The plots showing differences in the fit errors may be
used to compare the optimizers on their accuracy alone.

See src/README for documentation on the optimizer test suite.
